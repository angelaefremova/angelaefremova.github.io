        <p>Re: Internship for Front End Developer<br><br>
        Dear Hiring Manager,<br> I have
        always had a passion for technology and design. When introduced to
        programming it allowed me the ability to join my passions together. I
        came across the internship for Front End Developer post on Indeed, when
        looking further into Beshnas I found that your companies mission aligns
        with the skills and tasks I have implemented when working. When working
        as a database developer my goal was to automize the never ending supply
        of data and make it work for the organization and each team within, from
        marketing too engineering. During my time as a receptionist I was able
        to use my knowledge of the facility and of our members to better cater
        my selling statements to each new prospective member. Through college I
        have learned and applied my knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP and
        SQL to create responsive and alluring applications to generate web
        traffic. Thank you for you consideration and time, I understand the
        importance of engaging and user friendly interfaces to attract clients
        and create a system that benefits both Beshnas and the business that
        engage with it. If you have any further questions or have a chance to
        chat I can be reached by email at angelaefremova2000@gmail.com.
      <br><br>
      Sincerely, <br>
      Angela Efremova</p>
